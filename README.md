# Rust Book Learning Journey 🦀

This repository contains my code implementations and exercises while working through [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) (also known as "The Rust Book").

## About This Repository

As I progress through The Rust Book, I'm documenting my learning journey by implementing all the examples, exercises, and projects from each chapter. This repository serves as both a reference for my future self and a resource for others learning Rust.

## Structure

The repository is organized by chapters from The Rust Book:

```
Rust_book/
├── chapter_1/     # Getting Started
├── chapter_2/     # Programming a Guessing Game
├── chapter_3/     # Common Programming Concepts
└── ...
```

Each chapter directory contains:
- Code examples from the book
- Exercise solutions
- Personal notes and experiments
- Mini-projects related to the chapter's concepts

## Learning Path

- [x] Chapter 1: Getting Started
- [x] Chapter 2: Programming a Guessing Game
- [ ] Chapter 3: Common Programming Concepts
- [ ] Chapter 4: Understanding Ownership
- [ ] Chapter 5: Using Structs
- [ ] Chapter 6: Enums and Pattern Matching
- [ ] And more to come...

## Running the Code

Each chapter contains independent Rust projects. To run any example:

```bash
cd chapter_X/project_name
cargo run
```

To run tests:

```bash
cargo test
```

## Prerequisites

- Rust and Cargo (install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/))
- Basic understanding of programming concepts

## Resources

- [The Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [Rust Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/)
- [Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/)
- [Rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings) - Small exercises to get you used to reading and writing Rust code
